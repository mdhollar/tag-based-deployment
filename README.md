This repository contains code for generating VOLTTRON agent configuration based on Haystack tags. 
Currently there is config generator for 

1. Platform Driver Agent 
2. AirsideRCx Agent

# Currently supported device types:

1. AHU
2. VAV

# Currently supported datasources for haystack tags

1. Postgres database that contains haystack tags for equipments, and points.  
2. Json format files - one for equipment tags and one for point tags

# Platform Driver configuration generator classes:

1. DriverConfigGenerator: Base class that parses the configuration
2. IntellimationDriverConfigGenerator: Derives from DriverConfigGenerator and reads haystack tags from Intellimation 
   postgres database and generates platform driver configurations for AHUs and VAVs. 
3. JsonDriverConfigGenerator: Derives from DriverConfigGenerator and reads haystack tags from two json files - 
   one for equipment tags and one for point tags - and generates driver configurations for AHUs and VAVs

## Configuration for DriverConfigGenerator
The configuration file for this config generator script consists of four types of data
1. metadata - that gives the details of where the haystack data is stored and how to access it
2. Optional site, campus and building details that can be used to query data and also generate volttron topic names 
   prefix for devices
3. Configuration template - a json object that contains a template driver configuration based on driver type. 
   ConfiGenerator code looks for variables/string patterns in this string and replace it with device specific details 
   for generating individual device configuration
4. Optional output directory into which generated configurations are written. If provided code will try create the 
   directory provided and save generated configurations in it. Relative path are relative to path from which the 
   config generator script is run. If this configuration is not provided, default to "outputs" directory under the 
   code execution directory

Below is an example configuration for  IntellimationDriverConfigGenerator where metadata is in a postrgres database
```
 {
     "metadata": {
        "connection_params": {
                "dbname": "intellimation",
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 5432,
                "user": "postgres",
                "password": "volttron"
            },
        "equip_table": "equipment",
        "point_table": "points"
        },

     # If provided query will be filtered using this condition
     "site_id": "r:intellimation.dc_dgs.dcps.ojs",


     # Optional campus. If not provided will be parsed from site_id else will be empty. defaults to empty
     # "campus": "dcps",
     # Optional building or site name. If not provided parsed from site_id if site_id is provided. defaults to empty
     # "building": "",
     # optional driver topic_prefix. By default devices/<campus>/<building/site>/<device>/<subdevice>,
     "topic_prefix": "devices/WDC/OJS",

     # where generated configs should be saved. Code will try to do makedir -p
     "output_dir": "/home/volttron/git/intellimation/tag_based_setup/output/local_brookland_config",

     # Template for driver configuration
     "config_template": {
              "driver_type": "normalgw",
              "driver_config": {
                "point_service": "localhost:8080",
                "bacnet_service": "localhost:8080",
                "priority": 14,
                "query": "@period:[1, +inf] @attr_device_id:[{device_id},{device_id}] ",
                "topic_name_format": "object_name:{prop_object_name}"
              },
              "interval": 60
            }
 }
```
If the haystack tags are parsed from a json file, the metadata value in the above configuration can be changed to
```
"metadata": {
        "equip_json": "/path/to/json/Sitename_EQUIP_haystack.json",
        "points_json": "/path/to/json/Sitename_POINTS_haystack.json"
        }
```

Sample configurations can be found [here](configurations/driver)

# AirsideRCx configuration generator classes:

1. AirsideRCxConfigGenerator: Base class that parses the configuration
2. IntellimationAirsideRCxConfigGenerator: Derives from AirsideRCxConfigGenerator and reads haystack tags 
   from Intellimation postgres database and generates a AirsideRcx agent configuration for each AHU with one or more 
   VAVs. AHUs without VAVs are not included
3. JsonAirsideRCxConfigGenerator: Derives from AirsideRCxConfigGenerator and reads haystack tags from two json files 
   - one for equipment tags and one for point tags - and generates a AirsideRcx agent configuration for each AHU 
    with one or more VAVs. AHUs without VAVs are not included


##Configuration for AirsideRCxConfigGenerator
The configuration file for this config generator script consists of four types of data
1. metadata - that gives the details of where the haystack data is stored and how to access it
2. Optional site, campus and building details that can be used to query data and also generate volttron topic names 
   prefix for devices
3. Mandatory point metadata - 
   1. information on which field contains the point type information. For example, each point's type could be stored in 
      a haystack "dis" field.
   2. mapping of agent point type to haystack point type. For example, the point that has "fan_status" information 
      could have the metadata "SaFanCmd" in "dis" field of the point.
4. Configuration template - a json object that contains a template airsidercx configuration. 
   ConfiGenerator code inserts the campus, building, AHU, its vavs, and the point name details in this template and 
   generates one AirsideRCx config for each AHU
5. Optional output directory into which generated configurations are written. If provided code will try create the 
   directory provided and save generated configurations in it. Relative path are relative to path from which the 
   config generator script is run. If this configuration is not provided, default to "outputs" directory under the 
   code execution directory

If the haystack tags are parsed from a json file, the metadata value in the above configuration can be changed to
```
"metadata": {
        "equip_json": "/path/to/json/Sitename_EQUIP_haystack.json",
        "points_json": "/path/to/json/Sitename_POINTS_haystack.json"
        }
```
Sample configurations can be found [here](configurations/airsidercx)

**Note:**

 All the commented fields in the config_template or optional AirsideRCx configuration parameters and the commented 
 values are the default values used by the AirsideRCx agent. If you would like to uncomment and include any of these 
 parameters in your generated configurations, please make sure you add or remove any trailing commas to make the value 
 of "config_template" a valid json string. Commented line are for informational purpose only. None of the commented 
 lines will be in the final generated configuration.

# Running config generators
1. Clone source code:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/schandrika/intellimation_tcf
   cd intellimation_tcf
   ```
2. Install virtual environment
   You can install these parsers either on system python (for example, when using docker containers exclusively for this) or 
   install in a virtual environment when you are using a environment shared with other projects. 
   Creating virtual environment is highly recommended.
   To create a virtual environment and activate it for use run the command in the root directory of this project
   ```
   python3 -m venv ./.venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install parsers
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```
4. If your haystack tags are stored in postgresql database, you need to install python postgresql connector
   ```
   pip install psycopg2
   ```
5. Create configuration files for the parser that you want to run. Example configurations are available under configurations directory
6. Run parser
   1. To generate platform driver configurations using haystack tags stored in json file
      ```
      config-gen-json.driver <path to parser's configuration file>
      ```
   3. To generate platform driver configurations using haystack tags stored in postgres db 
      ```
      config-gen-db.driver <path to parser's configuration file>
      ```
   5. To generate airsidercx agent configurations using haystack tags stored in json file
      ```
      config-gen-json.airsidercx <path to parser's configuration file>
      ```
   7. To generate airsidercx agent configurations using haystack tags stored in postgres db 
      ```
      config-gen-db.airsidercx <path to parser's configuration file>
      ```
   Output files will be the path provided in configuration. If no output path is provided in configuration file, then 
   by default output gets written to <current directory>/<building_id>_driver_configs for driver config generator and 
   <current directory>/<building_id>_airsidercx_configs by airsidercx config generator. 
   Relative path is relative to the directory from which the command is run. 

# Extending config generators

These config generators use certain parsing logic specific to Intellimation sites. For example, how a device name is 
parsed and used to query data from a device using a normal framework driver interface is specific to Intellimation, 
however the base class and the child classes are structured such that the code can be easily extended for other 
sites that use different driver interface and database store for storing haystack tags. 
For example, a site that uses a bacnet driver can change the config_template in the configuration and override only 
the variable substitution code in a subclass. A site that stores haystack tags in different datastore can export the 
data in json format, subclass the JsonDriverConfigGenerator, reuse the json parsing logic to get list of ahus and vavs 
but override just the logic for variable substitution in config_template
